Master these strategies to build the most efficient and successful civilization.

[cyan::b]üöÄ Early Game Optimization[white::-]

[green]Opening Strategy:[white]
‚Ä¢ Build 2-3 houses immediately (population capacity)
‚Ä¢ Construct 1-2 farms for food security
‚Ä¢ Start Agriculture research ASAP
‚Ä¢ Monitor food consumption vs. production

[green]Resource Priority:[white]
1. [yellow]Food security[white] - Build farms before houses
2. [yellow]Population growth[white] - Houses enable more workers
3. [yellow]Wood production[white] - Lumber mills for construction materials
4. [yellow]Technology[white] - Research for efficiency improvements

[cyan::b]‚öñÔ∏è Mid Game Balance[white::-]

[green]Production Scaling:[white]
‚Ä¢ 1 farm per 10 villagers (approximate ratio)
‚Ä¢ 1 lumber mill per 20 villagers
‚Ä¢ 1 quarry per 30 villagers
‚Ä¢ Adjust based on construction needs

[green]Research Path:[white]
‚Ä¢ Agriculture ‚Üí Tool Making ‚Üí Construction
‚Ä¢ Pottery for food storage improvements
‚Ä¢ Metalworking to advance to Bronze Age

[cyan::b]üìä Advanced Optimization[white::-]

[yellow]Efficiency Multipliers:[white]
‚Ä¢ Tool Making research: +25% gathering
‚Ä¢ Agriculture research: +50% farm production
‚Ä¢ Advanced buildings compound these effects

[yellow]Resource Stockpiling:[white]
‚Ä¢ Keep 2-3 buildings worth of resources in reserve
‚Ä¢ Plan for research costs (some are expensive)
‚Ä¢ Save stone for advanced buildings

[yellow]Population Management:[white]
‚Ä¢ Optimal population: 3-5x your building count
‚Ä¢ Too many villagers without buildings = inefficiency
‚Ä¢ Too few villagers = slow resource generation

[cyan::b]üéØ Age Transition Strategy[white::-]

[green]Stone to Bronze Age:[white]
‚Ä¢ Requirements: Metalworking research, 50+ population
‚Ä¢ Preparation: Stockpile 500+ of each basic resource
‚Ä¢ Focus: Tool production, advanced buildings

[green]Bronze to Iron Age:[white]
‚Ä¢ Requirements: Advanced technologies, established infrastructure
‚Ä¢ Preparation: Diverse building types, efficient production
‚Ä¢ Focus: Specialization, optimization

[cyan::b]üíé Expert Techniques[white::-]

[yellow]Resource Cycling:[white]
‚Ä¢ Use excess food to fuel rapid building construction
‚Ä¢ Convert basic resources into advanced ones through buildings
‚Ä¢ Time research completion with resource availability

[yellow]Compound Growth:[white]
‚Ä¢ Every building pays for itself over time
‚Ä¢ Research improvements affect ALL future production
‚Ä¢ Early investments have exponential returns

[yellow]Bottleneck Management:[white]
‚Ä¢ Identify limiting resources (usually stone or tools)
‚Ä¢ Build production specifically for bottleneck resources
‚Ä¢ Research technologies that address constraints

[cyan::b]‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls[white::-]

‚Ä¢ [red]Overbuilding houses[white] without corresponding food production
‚Ä¢ [red]Ignoring research[white] - technology improvements are huge
‚Ä¢ [red]Resource hoarding[white] - unused resources don't generate value
‚Ä¢ [red]Impatience[white] - the game rewards planning and patience

[cyan::b]üèÜ Mastery Goals[white::-]

[green]Efficiency Targets:[white]
‚Ä¢ 100+ population by tick 200
‚Ä¢ All basic research complete by Bronze Age
‚Ä¢ Self-sustaining resource generation
‚Ä¢ Positive growth in all resource types

[green]Advanced Challenges:[white]
